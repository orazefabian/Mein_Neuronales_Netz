# My_Neural_Network
A neural network which can read a number 

Full neural network which can be trained by setting a learning rate and the amount of training runs.
It then can read a 28 x 28 pixel image and determine which number is written.

If you want to test the network make sure to use the already trained weights 
(w0_trained.p, w1_trained.p, w2_trained.p) and set "save weights" to False.
If you want to train your own weights use the prepared w0, w1, w2 files and set "use new weights" mode to True.
You can also save them temporally to these files.
